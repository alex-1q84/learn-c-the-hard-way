### doubly linked list (DLL) versus singly linked list (SLL)

- DLL takes more memory space because of extra pointer
- DLL can be iterator forward and backward
- SLL can only iterator forward
- when just need singly forward iteration or append and pop actions, it's more efficiently using DDL
- if need backward and forward iteration then DDL is more suitable

### limitations of doubly linked list

- random access is very slow
- memory is not continuous
